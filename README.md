Random Number Guessing Game â€“ Description ðŸŽ®
This is a simple Python-based number guessing game where:

1. The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 10.
2. The user is asked to guess the correct number.
3. If the guess is correct, it prints "You win!" ðŸŽ‰
4. If the guess is incorrect, it prints "Try again!" and allows another attempt.


How It Works
1. Import Random Module â€“ The game uses Python's random module to generate a random number.
2. User Input â€“ The player enters their guess.
3. Comparison â€“ The program checks if the guess matches the random number.
4. Feedback â€“ If correct, the player wins; if not, they can guess again.
